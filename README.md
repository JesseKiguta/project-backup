This is a prototype of a voting system.

The system begins from the login. To login successfully, you enter "admin" for the username and "password" for the password. It then redirects you to the dashboard.

The dashboard is what leads you, the user, to everything else on the system. The file containing the dashboard is `welcome.html`.

The core features of the app in brief are as follows:
1. **Creating a ballot. (Admin only feature)** The ballot is the rulebook of the election. It contains different parameters that are set and saved.
2. **Registering a candidate. (Admin only feature)** After creating the ballot, this feature specifies who (or what) goes on the ballot.
3. **Casting a vote. (Admin and User feature)** Last but not least is the core feature of the app. The user selects a candidate from the available candidates and submits the vote. May the odds be ever in their favor.

A non-essential but cool feature is that the system has both a light and dark mode you can toggle!
